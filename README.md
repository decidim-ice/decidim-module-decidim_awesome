Usability and UX tweaks for Decidim.

This plugin allows the administrators to expand the possibilities of Decidim beyond some existing limitations.
All tweaks are provided in a optional fashion with granular permissions that let the administrator to choose exactly where to apply those mods. Some tweaks can be applied to any assembly, other in an specific participatory process or even in type of component only.

**DISCLAIMER: This module is heavily tested and widely used, howevever we do not accept any responsibility for breaking anything. Feedback is appreciated though.**

## Why this plugin?

Decidim is an awesome platform, but it has some limitations that can be annoying for the users or the admins. This plugin tries to solve some of them. See the list of tweaks below.

## Usage

Read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for Decidim compatibility.

> **TL;DR people**: Jump to the [installation part](#installation)

DecidimAwesome is a module that hacks Decidim in order to provide more features or improve some aspects of it.

It generates and admin module that allows to choose what hacks to apply.
Each hack can be scoped to one or more specific participatory spaces or components.

### Tweaks:

#### 1. Image support for the Quill editor

Modifies the WYSIWYG editor in Decidim by adding the possibility to insert images. When uploading images, Drag & Drop is supported. Images will be uploaded to the server and inserted as external resources (it doesn't use base64 in-line encoding).

This feature allows you use images in newsletters as well.

![Images in Quill Editor](examples/quill-images.png)

#### 2. Auto-save for surveys and forms

With this feature admins can activate (globally or scoped) an auto-save feature for any form in Decidim.

It works purely in the client side by using LocalStorage capabilities of the browser. Data is store every time any field changes and retrieved automatically if the same user with the same browser returns to it in the future.

Saving the form removes the stored data.

![Auto save in forms](examples/auto-save.png)

#### 3. Images in proposals

Event if you haven't activated the WYSIWYG editor (Quill) in public views (eg: proposals use a simple textarea if rich text editor has not been activated for users). You can allow users to upload images in them by drag & drop over the text area.

![Proposal images](examples/proposal-images.png)

#### 4. Markdown editor for proposals

Allows to use markdown when creating proposals instead of a bare textarea.

#### 5. Admin scope configuration

All tweaks can be configured and scoped to a specific participatory space, a type of participatory space, a type of component or a specific component.

Many scopes can be defined for every tweak.

![Admin tweaks for editors](examples/admin-editors.png)

#### 6. Awesome map component

This is a component you can add in any participatory space. It retrieves all the geolocated content in that participatory space (meetings or proposals) and displays it in a big map.

It also provides a simple search by category, each category is assigned to a different color.

![Awesome map](examples/awesome-map.png)

#### 7. Fullscreen Iframe component

Another simple component that can be used to embed and Iframe with any external content in it that fills all the viewport.

![Fullscreen iframe](examples/fullscreen-iframe.png)

#### 8. Live support chat

With this feature you can have a support chat in Decidim. It is linked to a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group or a single user chat using the [[IntergramBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@IntergramBot). Just invite the bot to a group or chat with it directly, grab your ID, put it on the Awesome settings and have fun!. For more info or for hosting your own version of the bot check the [Intergram project](https://github.com/idoco/intergram).

![Intergram screenshot](examples/intergram.png)

#### 9. Custom CSS applied only according scoped restrictions

With this feature you can create directly in the admin a CSS snipped that is only applied globally, in a particular assembly or even a single proposal!

![CSS screenshot](examples/custom_styles.png)

#### 10. Change the main menu of Decidim entirely!

Feel free to hide, modify or add items in the Decidim's main menu. You can also change the order, establish some conditions (like showing only for logged users) or open in a new window.

#### 11. Assign admins to specific scopes and prevent them modify anything else

Convert any user on the platform (that is not currently an admin) to a limited subset of participatory spaces or event compoponents. Just add users to a box and scope them to some constraints. These users will se the "Edit" button in everywhere they have permissions. Any access to unallowed zones will redirect the user to the admin index page.

![Scoped admins configuration](examples/scoped_admins_config.png)

#### 12. Custom fields for proposals

Now admins can substitute the body of a proposal with a set of form fields.
Edition is make with a Drag & Drop interface in the admin and can (and should) be scoped to apply only to certain proposal components.

Technically, the content is stored in the database as an XML document compatible with normal HTML (it uses the DL/DT/DD elements).

![Custom fields screenshot](examples/custom-fields-1.png)

![Custom fields screenshot](examples/custom-fields-1.gif)

#### 13. Custom Redirections (or URL shortener feature)

Admins can create custom paths that redirect to other places. Destinations can be internal absolute paths or external sites.
There's also possible to choose to sanitize (ie: remove) any query string or to maintain it (so you can decide to use).

For instance you can create a redirection like 

* `/take-me-somewhere` => `/processes/canary-islands`

Using a link with a query string (ie: `/take-me-somewhere?locale=es`) that will redirect the user to:

* `/processes/canary-islands` if query string is sanitized
* `/processes/canary-islands?locale=es` if query string is not sanitized

> Redirections work only after all other routes have been processed, you cannot override an existing route.
> The admin panel comes with a button to check if the redirection works (meaning that no other route is used by te application).
> Non-working routes will simply be ignored.

![Custom redirections screenshot](examples/custom-redirections.png)

#### 14. Custom validation rules for title and body in proposals

Configure as you wish how the fields "title" and "body" are validated in proposals creation.

Rules available:

* Minimum title and body length (defaults to 15 chars).
* Maximum percentage of capital letters for title and body (defaults to 25%).
* Maximum number of "marks" (aka: exclamation and interrogation signs) that can be consective in the title or the body (defaults to 1).
* Enable/disable forcing to start the title or the body with a capital letter (defaults to "enabled").

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-decidim_awesome"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
bundle exec rails decidim_decidim_awesome:install:migrations
bundle exec rails decidim_decidim_awesome:webpacker:install
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

> NOTE: the `decidim_decidim_awesome:webpacker:install` is only necessary for Decidim versions starting at 0.25.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.8, make sure to visit the URL `/admin/decidim_awesome/checks` and run image migrations for the old images:

![Check image migrations](examples/check_image_migrations.png)

If you are a system admin, you can also perform this task by executing this rake task in the console:

```
RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails decidim_awesome:active_storage_migrations:migrate_from_carrierwave
```

Or check your migration status with:
```
RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails decidim_awesome:active_storage_migrations:check_migration_from_carrierwave
```

The correct version of Decidim Awesome should resolved automatically by the Bundler.
However you can force some specific version using `gem "decidim-decidim_awesome", "~> 0.8.0"` in the Gemfile.

Depending on your Decidim version, choose the corresponding Awesome version to ensure compatibility:

| Awesome version | Compatible Decidim versions |
|---|---|
| 0.9.x | 0.26.x, 0.27.x |
| 0.8.x | 0.25.x, 0.26.x |
| 0.7.x | 0.23.x, 0.24.x |
| 0.6.x | 0.22.x, 0.23.x |
| 0.5.x | 0.21.x, 0.22.x |

> *Heads up!* 
> * version 0.8.0 removes CSS Themes for tenants. If you have been using them you will have to manually migrate them to custom styles.
> * version 0.8.0 uses ActiveStorage, same as Decidim 0.25. 2 new rake task have been introduced to facilitate the migration: `bin/rails decidim_awesome:active_storage_migrations:check_migration_from_carrierwave` and 
`bin/rails decidim_awesome:active_storage_migrations:migrate_from_carrierwave`
> * version 0.7.1 requires database migrations! Don't forget the migrations step when updating.

## Configuration

Each tweak can be enabled or disabled by default. It also can be deactivated so
admins do not even see it.

In order to personalize default values, create an initializer such as:

> **NOTE**: this is not necessary unless you want to **disable** some features. All features are enabled by default.

```ruby
# config/initializers/awesome_defaults.rb

# Change some variables defaults
Decidim::DecidimAwesome.configure do |config|
  # Enabled by default to all scopes, admins can still limit it's scope
  config.allow_images_in_full_editor = true

  # Disabled by default to all scopes, admins can enable it and limit it's scope
  config.allow_images_in_small_editor = false

  # De-activated, admins don't even see it as an option
  config.use_markdown_editor = :disabled

  # Disable scoped admins
  config.scoped_admins = :disabled

  # any other config var from lib/decidim/decidim_awesome.rb
  ...
end
```

For a complete list of options take a look at the [module defaults](lib/decidim/decidim_awesome.rb).

## Missing something?

We add new features and maintain them, however we do it according our needs as this is mostly voluntary work.
So if you feel that you can contribute feel free to create a pull request with your idea. We are open to incorporate anything reasonable.

We do ask some things:
- Each feature has to come with and activation option, same as the already existing (unless is something that do not modify predefined Decidim behavior)
- Try to avoid views or assets overrides. Many times it is just enough to add additional css or scripts that alter existing objects.

You can also ask for new feature by creating and issue and, if you are ready to provide funds for its development just contact us!

Thanks!

## Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
bundle
DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
cd development_app
DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rails s
```

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Atom - [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
bundle
DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

However, this project works with different versions of Decidim. In order to test them all, we maintain two different Gemfiles: `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.legacy`. The first one is used for development and testing the latest Decidim version supported, the second one is used for testing against the old Decidim version.

You can run run tests against the legacy Decidim versions by using:

```bash
export DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> 
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> 
RBENV_VERSION=2.7.6 BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.legacy bundle
RBENV_VERSION=2.7.6 BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.legacy bundle exec rake test_app
RBENV_VERSION=2.7.6 BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.legacy bundle exec rspec
```

For convenience, you can use the scripts `bin/rspec` and `bin/rspec-legacy` to run tests against one or the other version:

```bash
bin/rspec spec/
bin/rspec-legacy spec/
```

- Rbenv is required for this script to work.

> **NOTE:** Remember to reset the database when changing between tests:
> ```bash
> bin/rspec --reset
> bin/rspec-legacy --reset
> ```


Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

Code coverage report is generated automatically in a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.

```bash
firefox coverage/index.html
```
