            description: |
              You can define any route (starting with <code>/</code>) to redirect any visitor to a destination URL.<br>
              Destination can be an absolute path (ie: <code>/processes/some-process</code>) or start with <code>https://</code> (ie: <code>http://decidim.org</code>)<br><br>
              Take into account that a redirection only works if none other route matches. It is not possible to override original routes (this is by design).<br>
              If unsure, use the check redirections button to test for incompatibilities.
