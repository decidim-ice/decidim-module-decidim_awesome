            description: |
              You can define any route (starting with <code>/</code>) to redirect any visitor to a destination URL.<br>
              Destination can be an absolute path (ie: <code>/processes/some-process</code>) or start with <code>https://</code> (ie: <code>http://decidim.org</code>)<br><br>
              Take into account that a redirection only works if none other route matches. It is not possible to override original routes (this is by design).<br>
              If unsure, use the check redirections button to test for incompatibilities.

              This tool allows you to delete all private data for a specific participatory space or component. This action is irreversible and will remove all private data from the database.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What is considered private data?</strong>
              <br>
              Private data is any information that is not publicly available and is only accessible to administrators. This, at the moment, includes private custom fields information.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What happens when I delete private data?</strong>
              <br>
              When you delete private data, all private information for the selected participatory space or component will be permanently removed from the database. A log of this action will be stored in the system for auditing purposes.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What happens to public data?</strong>
              <br>
              Public data will not be affected by this action. Only private data will be deleted.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Is there a minimum time to wait before deleting private data?</strong>
              <br>
              Yes, you cannot delete private data if the last update was less than %{time_ago} ago. You can change this configuration in the initializer file.
            items_count: Total affected
            last_date: Last update
            no_data: No private data found older than %{time_ago} ago
            not_destroyable: This resource cannot be destroyed yet
