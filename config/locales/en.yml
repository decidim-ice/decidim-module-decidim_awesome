              This tool allows you to delete all private data for a specific participatory space or component. This action is irreversible and will remove all private data from the database.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What is considered private data?</strong>
              <br>
              Private data is any information that is not publicly available and is only accessible to administrators. This, at the moment, includes private custom fields information.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What happens when I delete private data?</strong>
              <br>
              When you delete private data, all private information for the selected participatory space or component will be permanently removed from the database. A log of this action will be stored in the system for auditing purposes.
              <br><br>
              <strong>What happens to public data?</strong>
              <br>
              Public data will not be affected by this action. Only private data will be deleted.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Is there a minimum time to wait before deleting private data?</strong>
              <br>
              Yes, you cannot delete private data if the last update was less than %{time_ago} ago. You can change this configuration in the initializer file.
